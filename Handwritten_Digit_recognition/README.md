This project uses PyTorch and CNN to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
--The train set is 60000 handwritten digits from 0 to 9 in grayscale.
--The test set is 10000 handwritten digits from 0 to 9 in grayscale.
--The model is: 
  2 convolutional layers, 
  dropout layer,
  relu activation function in the hidden layers,
  softmax activation function in the output layer.
