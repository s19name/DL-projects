# Age-and-Gender-prediction-using-CNN-model
This project is done for the "Machine Learning with Python" course. Improved the ability of CNN to predict by data augmentation. 
The accuracy is 0.88 for gender prediction and MAE 6.7 years old, which means the model predicts the age with about 6.7 years of difference. 
Adam optimizator, BinaryCrossentropy and MAE metrics were used.
